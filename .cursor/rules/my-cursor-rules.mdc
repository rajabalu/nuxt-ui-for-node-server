# Project programming standards

- Do not use new compoenets or libraries. Always use existing pattern and components
- Do not change the existing styling or introduce new styling or theme. Always use existing style and theme
- Always re-use existing components. Introduce new components or pages only if it is neccessary. 
- Always understand the existing project structure and implementation standards before making any changes.
- Don't give multiple options. Choose the best and robust and working option and implement that.
